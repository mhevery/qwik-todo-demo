## Take a tour

1. The TODO app should have come up in the stackblitz IDE. 
2. Open it in the inspector and notice that the app was delivered as HTML
3. Notice that very little JS got downloade/executed with the application
4. Open the network tab, and notice that more code is downloaded as you interact with the application.
5. Look for `on:click`/`on:keyup` element attributes which define event listener
